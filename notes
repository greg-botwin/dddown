# Notes
- The Description Title is the text viewed on the Tab in the browswer
- The Description Title and Description due not line up with README/first page of website
- pkgdown only makes referene to documented functions??
- create_package check_name = FALSE because data dictionary not expected to be submitted to cran
-create_package set open = FALSE do not want new package to open for end user
- it is best to use this package not in an existing package since it will create a new directory for you
- going to need a function to test data dictionary is properly formatted
- should create file overwrite



dd <- dd_read("~/Downloads/test-case-01-data-dictionary.csv")
write_refe
